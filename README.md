# TypeScript Project with Decorators

## Description
This TypeScript project demonstrates the use of class, method, and accessor decorators to enhance functionality in a TypeScript app. 
The project includes a `MyTestClass` that utilizes decorators to log messages, handle method invocation logging, and enforce read-only access to class properties.

## Features
- **Simple Logger Decorator**: Logs a message whenever a class instance is created.
- **Method Logger Decorator**: Logs details whenever specific methods are called, including the method name and arguments.
- **Read-Only Accessor Decorator**: Enforces read-only access to specific class properties.
